      <h2>Moose: In Loving Memory</h2>

        <p>This painting of Abbie's dog Moose took about
        four hours to make. One of the hardest parts about
        making this piece was that Abbie only knew
        Moose when she was young so I had to go off
        her memories of what he looked like.
        I found reference pictures and we decided
        that he looked a lot like a collie so I tried my best to
        replicate the anatomy of a collie in a cartoon
        style.</p>

      <h2>Speaking of Abbie...</h2>

        <p>I don't think this piece needs too much of an explanation.
          The inspiration behind it was that I
          wanted to attempt a portrait and
          Abbie said, "hey you should draw me!"
          So, like any good friend would, I drew her.
          The final piece took around 2 hours and 20 minutes.
          I think it turned out pretty good and
          my favorite part is definitely the hair.</p>

      <h2>An Ocean Sunset</h2>

        <p>This was my first painting for this project and 
          it is also the one I am most proud of. 
          For this piece I followed a Bob Ross tutorial but changed it up a bit. 
          It depicts a coastal sunset with waves rippling in. 
          The challenge with this piece was that the original was traditional art and 
          translating it to digital form was very difficult and time-consuming. 
          There was still another half to this painting but I stopped where I was 
          because I had already spent almost 10 hours on it! Despite its difficulties 
          and flaws, this painting is still my favorite and I hope to come 
          back to it one day and finish it fully.</p>
